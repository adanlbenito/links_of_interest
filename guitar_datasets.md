## Guitarset: A Dataset For Guitar Transcriptions

High quality guitar recordings alongside rich annotations and metadata.
In particular, by recording guitars using a hexaphonic pickup, we are able to not only provide recordings of the individual strings but also to largely automate the expensive annotation process, therefore providing rich annotation.
The dataset contains recordings of a variety of musical excerpts played on an acoustic guitar, along with time-aligned annotations including pitch contours, string and fret positions, chords, beats, downbeats, and playing style.

## Electric Guitars Dataset

The Electric Guitars Dataset is a database of audio recordings of electric guitars designed specifically for research on electric guitarâ€™s sound characteristics and for the identification and/or classification of different electric guitar types.

## IDMT-SMT-Guitar

The IDMT-SMT-GUITAR database is a large database for automatic guitar transcription. Seven different guitars in standard tuning were used with varying pick-up settings and different string measures to ensure a sufficient diversification in the field of electric and acoustic guitars. The recording setup consisted of appropriate audio interfaces, which were directly connected to the guitar output or in one case to a condenser microphone. The recordings are provided in one channel RIFF WAVE format with 44100 Hz sample rate.
